# Introduction to Programming – Week 1  
**Lab Logbook Summary**

## Overview
This lab introduced the fundamental concepts of programming using Python. It focused on understanding different types of programming languages, using the Python interpreter, writing and evaluating basic expressions, understanding operator precedence, handling errors, and learning key programming terminology. These concepts form the foundation for future programming modules.

## Types of Programming Languages
Programming languages have evolved to improve usability and efficiency.

- **2GL (Second Generation Languages):** Low-level languages such as Assembly, closely related to machine code.
- **3GL (Third Generation Languages):** High-level, general-purpose languages (e.g. Python, C, C++, Java) that balance readability, portability, and performance.
- **4GL (Fourth Generation Languages):** Highly abstract and domain-specific languages such as SQL and R, which focus on *what* the program should do rather than *how*.

Programming **paradigms** include procedural, object-oriented, functional, and aspect-oriented approaches. Python is a **multi-paradigm, interpreted 3GL**, allowing flexibility in problem-solving.

## Python Interpreter and REPL
Python programs are executed using an **interpreter**, which processes code line by line.

- Python supports the **REPL model**: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop.
- Interactive mode allows quick testing and immediate feedback.
- The `>>>` prompt indicates the interpreter is ready to accept commands.
- Commands such as `print()`, `help()`, and `quit()` are commonly used.
- The built-in help system assists with syntax and object documentation.

## Basic Expressions and Operators
An **expression** is a combination of operands (values) and operators that produces a result.

Common operators include:
- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction
- `*` multiplication
- `/` division
- `//` floor division
- `%` modulus (remainder)
- `**` exponentiation

Expressions are used for calculations, decision-making (selection), and repetition (iteration).

## Operator Precedence
Python evaluates expressions based on operator precedence, not always left to right.

Order of precedence (highest to lowest):
1. `()` Parentheses  
2. `**` Exponentiation  
3. `* / // %` Multiplication, division, floor division, modulus  
4. `+ -` Addition and subtraction  

Parentheses can be used to control and clarify the order of evaluation, reducing logical errors.

## Errors in Programming
Errors are a normal part of programming and are generally classified as:

- **Syntax Errors:**  
  Occur when Python grammar rules are violated (e.g. incomplete expressions). These are usually easy to identify and fix.

- **Logical (Run-time) Errors:**  
  Occur during program execution due to incorrect logic (e.g. division by zero or invalid input). These errors can be difficult to detect and may not always stop program execution.

Good programs validate input and handle errors gracefully.

## Key Terminology
- **Source Code:** Human-readable program instructions.
- **Machine Code:** Binary instructions executed by the CPU.
- **Interpreter:** Executes code line by line.
- **Compiler:** Translates source code into an executable file.
- **Executable:** A program that can be run by a computer.
- **Expression:** A statement that evaluates to a value.
- **Operators:** Symbols that perform operations.
- **Operands:** Values used in expressions.
- **Syntax Errors:** Errors in program structure.
- **Logical Errors:** Errors in program logic or behaviour.

## Conclusion
This lab provided essential knowledge of programming concepts and hands-on experience with the Python interpreter. Understanding these basics is crucial for writing correct programs and for progressing to more advanced programming topics..
